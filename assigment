Exercise 1: Create a Responsive Container
Create a webpage with:
A container that includes a heading: "Welcome to Bootstrap Containers".
Below it, add a paragraph: "This is a fixed-width container."
Add another container-fluid below with a heading: "Welcome to Fluid Containers".
Include a paragraph: "This container takes up the full width of the screen."
Use different background colors for the two sections for visual distinction.
Exercise 2: Customize Text Colors
Create a page with three paragraphs:
The first paragraph should use Bootstrap's text-primary class.
The second paragraph should use text-danger class.
The third paragraph should use text-success class.
Add a heading above each paragraph, describing the text color it represents.
Exercise 3: Styling the Background
Create a page with three sections:
The first section should have a bg-light class.
The second section should have a bg-info class.
The third section should have a bg-dark class with text styled in white (text-white).
Add some text inside each section to describe its background color.
Exercise 4: Combine Container, Text, and Background
Design a webpage with the following:
A container with a bg-primary background and text-white text. Add a heading and a paragraph inside.
Inside the same container, create a row with two columns:
One column with bg-danger and text-light.
The other column with bg-success and text-dark.
Add sample text in both columns.
